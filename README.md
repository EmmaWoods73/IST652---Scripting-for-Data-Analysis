# IST652---Scripting-for-Data-Analysis
Developer Profiles and Job Market Analysis

This team-based project used Python scripts to access, amass and analyze data from multiple data sources in order to profile the characteristics of current software developers. Current circumstances related to compensation, job skills, preferences and other factors were explored, in addition to the job market for software developers and how this relates to specific job requirements and preferences of the profiles analyzed within the project.

Multiple datasets are incorporated into the analysis, combining structured, semi-structured and text (unstructured) data sources. Job posting information is 
obtained through the use of API's and RSS feeds in order to incorporate analysis of current job postings for software developers. 

Platforms used: Python (Jupyter notebook and Google Colab for collaboration)

Key skills: Data acquisition, data munging, MongoDB, Pandas, NLTK for NLP techniques for unstructured (text) data
